## Overview

The Smart Resume Screener is a robust backend application designed to automate and enhance the initial stages of the technical recruitment process. It intelligently parses candidate resumes (PDF or TXT), leverages the Google Gemini Large Language Model to score them against a given job description, and provides a ranked shortlist of candidates with detailed, AI-generated justifications.

This project demonstrates a modern, API-driven approach to solving a real-world business problem, combining solid backend engineering with the power of generative AI.

## Architecture

The application is designed with a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture.

### High-Level System Architecture

The system consists of three primary components: the central API, a persistent database, and an external AI service. The client interacts exclusively with the API, which orchestrates all internal logic and external calls.

### Internal Application Architecture

The application's internal structure follows a classic **Layered Architecture**, a core design principle for building robust backend services. This separates the code into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/abh1shekChoudhary/Smart-Resume-Screener.git](https://github.com/abh1shekChoudhary/Smart-Resume-Screener.git)
    cd Smart-Resume-Screener
    ```

2.  **Set up the Database:**
    - Ensure you have a MySQL server running.
    - Create a new database named `resume_screener_db`.
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE resume_screener_db;
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - In `src/main/resources/`, rename `application.properties.example` to `application.properties`.
    - Open the new `application.properties` file and update the following fields with your credentials:
        - `spring.datasource.username`
        - `spring.datasource.password`
        - `gemini.api.key`

4.  **Build and Run the Application:**
    - Use Maven to run the application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    - The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## LLM Prompt Engineering

The core AI functionality relies on a multi-faceted approach to prompt engineering to ensure reliable, accurate, and safe outputs from the Google Gemini model.

### 1. Prompt Design

The prompt is structured to guide the model's behavior and output format.

- **Role Prompting:** The model is assigned a clear role (`act as an expert evaluator`) to frame its context and produce higher-quality analysis.
- **Structured Output Instruction:** The prompt explicitly instructs the model to return its analysis in a **clean JSON object**. This is critical for reliable, programmatic parsing on the backend.
- **Clear Task Definition:** The task is unambiguously defined: compare texts, rate on a specific scale, provide a justification, and extract relevant skills.

**Prompt Used:**

Compare the following resume with this job description. Your task is to:

Rate the fit on a scale of 1-10.

Provide a detailed justification for your rating.

Extract a list of the top 5-7 most relevant skills from the resume that match the job description.

The resume is:

{resumeText}

The job description is:

{jobDescriptionText}.

Return your answer as a clean JSON object with three keys: 'score' (an integer), 'justification' (a string), and 'skills' (an array of strings).


### 2. Generation & Safety Configuration

Beyond the prompt text, the application configures the model's generation parameters to control the output's quality and consistency.

**Generation Configuration:**
| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `temperature` | `0.7` | Balances creativity and factual consistency in the justification. |
| `topP` | `0.95` | Controls the diversity of the response. |
| `topK` | `64` | Limits the token selection to the most likely choices. |
| `maxOutputTokens` | `8192` | Sets a generous limit for the length of the AI's response. |

**Safety Settings:**
The application implements standard safety settings to ensure all AI-generated content remains professional and appropriate.

| Category | Threshold |
| :--- | :--- |
| `HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT` | `BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE` |
| `HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH` | `BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE` |
| `HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT`| `BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE` |
| `HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT`| `BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE` |


### 3. Robust Output Handling

The application anticipates and handles a common LLM behavior: wrapping JSON responses in Markdown. A post-processing step sanitizes the model's output to ensure the parser receives a clean, valid JSON string.

```java
// Example of the cleaning logic in LLMService.java
String cleanedJson = llmResponseText.trim().replace("```json", "").replace("```", "");
This multi-step process of prompt design, configuration, and output handling demonstrates a comprehensive approach to integrating generative AI into a production-ready application.
